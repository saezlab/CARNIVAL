\usage{
prune_network(network, upstream_nodes, downstream_nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A dataframe with three columns: source, target, and sign.}

\item{upstream_nodes}{A character vector of upstream node names.}

\item{downstream_nodes}{A character vector of downstream node names.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of the pruned network with three columns: source, target, and sign.
}
\description{
Prune a network by upstream and downstream nodes
}
\details{
This function takes a network in dataframe format with three columns
(source, target, and interaction), a set of upstream nodes, and a set of downstream nodes.
It returns a pruned network containing only nodes that can be reached downstream
of the upstream set of nodes and upstream of the downstream set of nodes.

\examples{
# Sample network data
network_data <- data.frame(
  source = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "D", "E"),
  target = c("B", "C", "C", "D", "E", "F", "F"),
  interaction = c(1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1)
)

# Upstream and downstream node sets
upstream_nodes <- c("A", "B")
downstream_nodes <- c("E", "F")

# Prune the network
pruned_network <- prune_network(network_data, upstream_nodes, downstream_nodes)
print(pruned_network)
